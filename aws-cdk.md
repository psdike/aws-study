To configure an EC2 instance using AWS CDK in Python, you will need to define an EC2 construct and configure its properties. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started:

1. Install the necessary dependencies:
   - Ensure you have the AWS CDK and the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) installed. You can install them using pip:
     ```bash
     pip install aws-cdk.core aws-cdk.aws-ec2
     ```

2. Set up a new AWS CDK project:
   - Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it.
   - Run the following command to initialize a new CDK project:
     ```bash
     cdk init app --language python
     ```

3. Define your EC2 instance:
   - Open the `app.py` file in your project directory using a code editor.
   - Remove the existing placeholder code and import the required CDK and EC2 modules:
     ```python
     from aws_cdk import core
     import aws_cdk.aws_ec2 as ec2
     ```

   - Within the `MyStack` class, define the EC2 instance:
     ```python
     class MyStack(core.Stack):
         def __init__(self, scope: core.Construct, id: str, **kwargs) -> None:
             super().__init__(scope, id, **kwargs)

             # Create a new VPC
             vpc = ec2.Vpc(self, "MyVPC", cidr="10.0.0.0/16")

             # Create an EC2 instance within the VPC
             instance = ec2.Instance(self, "MyInstance",
                 instance_type=ec2.InstanceType("t2.micro"),
                 vpc=vpc
             )
     ```

4. Deploy your stack:
   - In your project directory, run the following command to synthesize the AWS CloudFormation template for your CDK app:
     ```bash
     cdk synth
     ```

   - Once the synthesis process is complete, run the following command to deploy the stack to your AWS account:
     ```bash
     cdk deploy
     ```

   - CDK will provide you with a preview of the changes that will be made. Confirm the deployment by entering "y" when prompted.

5. Verify your EC2 instance:
   - After the deployment is successful, AWS CDK will create the necessary resources, including your EC2 instance.
   - You can go to the AWS Management Console or use AWS CLI/Boto3 to verify the creation and configuration of your EC2 instance.

This is a basic example of configuring an EC2 instance using AWS CDK in Python. You can further customize the instance by adding additional properties such as security groups, user data, tags, etc. Refer to the AWS CDK documentation and the AWS CDK Python API reference for more information on available options and configurations for EC2 instances and other related resources.
